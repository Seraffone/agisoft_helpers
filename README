These are some scripts that are being used to help automate the use of Photoscan.

Many of these will be a work in progress and incomplete, so assume that they will not do what you think they will do.


== master.py

This is mostly just all of the other scripts lumped into one. Rather than performing the tasks directly, this script will create menu items for running each task.

== stage_one.py

This script makes a few assumptions.

1) Directory structure is as follows,

[identifier]
	\JPG\
		\SIDEA\ -- location of jpegs for top view
		\SIDEB\ -- location of jpegs for bottom view
	\PROCESSING\ -- location to be used for psx file

2) The 'top' and 'bottom' sets of images are split in to the SIDEA and SIDEB directories.

3) 'Camera calibration' grouping will be automatically determined by Agisoft. This should be OK for changes that are reflected in the EXIF data of the JPG files.

4) Network processing is being used.

== stage_two.py

This will duplicate the "Aligned" chunks for optimization.
